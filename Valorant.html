<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FFFFFF">Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games.[3] A free-to-play game, Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020 for Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.
